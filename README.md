Covid-19 project using Machine Learning in Python
  Although it's still too early for much COVID-19-specific machine learning research to have been developed which is more precise and accurate, here is a kind of beta project which is implemented using machine learning approach followed by some prominent python libraries like seaborn, tenserflow and so on. 
  
  So overall, this project predicts whether patient is having covid-19 symptoms or not and if probability of him/her of having corona is there or not by analyzing images of lungs of the patient from dataset.
